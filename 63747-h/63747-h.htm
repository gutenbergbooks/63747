<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Trinity College, March, 1888.</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>The essays which have appeared in
the previous numbers of <span class='sc'>The Archive</span>
are specimens of work done in the English
Department. The following essay,
which has been placed at our disposal,
is taken from the work done by
the Freshman Class in the Department
of History:</p>

<h3 class='c018'>The First Hundred Years of the Constitution.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The struggle for independence had
ended. The British, with the exception
of a few forts in the Northwest
Territory, had retired from the United
States. Peace had been made four
years before; yet the state of affairs
in the country was such that even the
most sanguine began to rue the day
that the colonies had thrown off their
allegiance to the British crown. Contrary
to the expectations of every one,
prosperity did not come with peace.
The people had no money, the government
had none. The roads were
very bad and consequently very little
headway could be made at traveling
and transportation. The farmers were
obliged to do a large part of their work
with wooden tools, and of course it
was very imperfectly done. Many who
had been in a state of affluence before
the war were reduced to a state of indigence.
There were also very few
schools. Now it is evident that this
state of affairs was calculated to create
discontent among the people and a
spirit of distrust in the government.
The soldiers who had fought so hard
and had suffered so much during the
war were either granted lands in the
West, which at that time were of little
value, since the Indians kept the settlers
in a state of constant terror, or
they were dismissed with the promise
that they would be paid as soon as the
country should recover from the financial
depression which the war had
caused. Congress had contracted a
large debt with France and Holland,
and, as it had no power under the “Articles
of Confederation” to lay taxes,
it had no means of paying this debt or
of rewarding the soldiers. England
also was injuring the commerce of the
States by seizing their merchant vessels,
and Congress had no means of
prohibiting her. The people began to
see and to feel that the “Articles of
Confederation” were insufficient for the
government of the country. In reply
to the repeated demands of the people,
Congress, in 1787, called an assembly
of delegates to revise the “Articles,”
and to devise such provisions as might
render the “Constitution of the Federal
government adequate to the exigencies
of the Union.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The convention met in Philadelphia.
The States sent their ablest men; and
well they did, for dependent upon their
actions and decision was the destiny of
a great nation. After a discussion of
some weeks, the Constitution was decided
upon. This Constitution, unlike
the “Articles of Confederation,” gave
Congress power to <i>act</i>, and not simply
to advise the States. The government
provided for by this Constitution
was to be republican in its nature and
was to consist of three departments:
a Legislative department, or Congress,
to make laws; an Executive department,
the President and his officers, to
enforce the laws enacted by Congress;
and a Judiciary department, the Federal
Courts, to decide disputed questions
under the law. The Legislative and
Executive departments, working in
unison, were to govern the country,
always acting in accordance with the
Constitution as interpreted by the Judiciary
department.</p>

<p class='c009'>This form of government went into
effect, being ratified by New Hampshire,
the ninth State, in 1788.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the first year of the administration
of Washington, the first ten
amendments were proposed. We may
assign the same reason for the early
proposal of these amendments as that
which caused nearly half of the members
of the convention to vote against
the Constitution. This cause was, we
think, that the States feared that too
much power would be given to the
Federal government. These ten amendments
were adopted in 1791, thus assuring
to the people freedom of speech
and of press, trial by jury and a great
many other privileges. The third
clause in the first amendment—Congress
shall make no law abridging the
freedom of speech or of press—was
not very strictly adhered to in later
days. For instance, the “Sedition
Law,” passed by Congress during the
administration of John Adams, was
disregardful of this clause. The eleventh
amendment, limiting judiciary
power, was adopted in 1798. When
the presidential election of 1800 came,
the Republican candidates were Jefferson
and Burr. The votes being counted,
it was found that they had received an
equal number. It now fell to Congress
to decide which should be President.
On the thirty-sixth ballot Jefferson
received the majority, and Burr, his political
opponent, became Vice-President.
In order that this defect in
election might be removed, the twelfth
amendment was adopted in 1804. It
provided that the electors should meet
in their respective States, and vote by
ballot for President, and in a distinct
ballot for Vice-President.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people had put aside their old
Puritan customs and fashions, and had
come to think and act to a great extent
as the people of to-day. They were energetic
and were steadily rising, soon to
take their stand in the foremost rank of
the nations of the world. Already foreign
nations had begun to respect their
claims, yet the country was doomed to
be rent by civil strife and to flow with
the blood of her sturdiest sons. The
war soon passed away, the feeling soon
died out, and the North and the South
were known no more as two sections
disputing about State Sovereignty, but
as different sections of the same great
nation, governed by the same laws,
enjoying the same liberty and freedom,
and worshipping the same Divine
Being. The termination of this war in
favor of the North gave rise to the
thirteenth amendment, prohibiting slavery
in any part of the United States
or in any of her colonies, except as
punishment for some crime whereof the
party shall have been duly convicted.
The fourteenth amendment was adopted
in the year 1868. The fifteenth and
last amendment was adopted in 1870.
This gives to each and every citizen of
the United States regardless of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude,
the right to vote.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus we see that but fifteen amendments
have been added to the Constitution
in little over one hundred years;
and these became necessary, not because
the convention of 1787 did its
work so imperfectly, but because the
growth of the country in population,
in wealth, and the change of the condition
and avocations of a majority of
the people demanded them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us notice some of these changes.
During the Revolutionary war and the
period between the close of the war
and the adoption of the constitution,
there were no railroads and no telegraphs,
there were but very few factories,
and those very clumsily built.
The public roads were in a very bad
condition, so that the majority of the
people knew nothing of the country
except that part of it which was in
their immediate neighborhood, for
there were no means of communication
between different sections, and
where there is little or no communication
between two sections, they know
very little of each other. There were
strong States oppressing the weaker
ones and contentions between State
and State concerning their western
boundaries. About sixty years later,
we find that the electric telegraph had
been invented and was in successful
use and that there were railroads on
every hand. There was close communication
between the different sections,
so that every one was, or ought
to have been, posted on the issues of
the times. There were many factories
of many kinds built on improved
plans, thus changing the employments
of a great many citizens. All the
States with fixed boundaries were
working in unison with but one purpose
in view, and that the furtherance
of the general good. In the former
time, farming was the occupation of
the masses; in the later, they were
engaged in almost every industry
known to the world. The population
had increased from three millions (3,000,000)
to over seventeen millions
(17,000,000), and the wealth of the
people had also increased wonderfully.
Great political changes had come
about. The issues of the times were
entirely different, and in order that
these issues might be rightly legislated
upon, changes were made in the constitution,
and these changes constitute
the amendments.</p>

<p class='c009'>With this constitution as a basis, our
country has, for the past century, been
a prosperous and happy country. She
has increased in population and wealth
as no other nation on earth has increased.
If she goes on increasing as
she has increased, half a century hence
she will have two hundred millions of
people, and there will be no power on
earth to compare with her; for she will
not be such as China, Hindoostan, Russia,
but a nation of civilized men, helped
by steam, electricity and machinery, so
that each man can do as much work as
a score of Chinese. She could then
maintain fleets and armies enough to
overawe the remainder of the world.
She could make other nations yield to
her slightest demand. She could make
herself a bully and a nuisance among
nations. When the United States becomes
such a power as this, if rightly
ruled, it may be made a great blessing
to the world. If the moral forces,
which have made the country what it
is, should be lost, national decay would
soon rid the earth of the evil, and free
other nations from anxiety. North
America has been the burial place of
other races before ours, and it may yet
be the graveyard of our own. If every
man will fight every evil he sees, if he
lives out man’s allotted time of life, he
will be rewarded in seeing his country
respected and honored by all other
nations as no nation has yet been respected
or honored, and in feeling that
he has done his part in the great work.</p>

<h3 id='t86' class='c018'>[For the Archive.]</h3>

<p class='c019'>The favorable notices of the Alumni
of Trinity are interesting, especially to
an old student. This department as a
medium of communication between
old graduates serves in many instances
as an advertising column. All the
editors ask of you for this is your subscription.
And the Alumnus or any
other old student who takes so little
interest in the affairs of his own college
that he does not subscribe for its publications,
I fear has lost his patriotism.</p>

<p class='c009'>The get-up of <span class='sc'>The Archive</span> is commendable—the
carefully prepared articles
deserve the attention of every
Alumnus—the book reviews are both
interesting and instructive, and the
exclusion of long, dry articles is admirable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The Archive</span> is not the only thing
at Trinity that demands our attention.
The reports and circulars issued by
President Crowell demonstrate the
working of a scholar and a live educator.
They are truly inspiring, and
every teacher in the State could well
afford to read them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proposed re-union of the old
students and officers of the college, at
the approaching Commencement, will
meet with the approval of every
friend of the institution. Of course
the Alumni have their annual re-unions;
but all who have ever been connected
with the institution should assemble.
Let us have a grand re-union that will
inspire every one with new energy and
a determination to work more faithfully
than ever. Let us meet and examine
the log-book and see that the old ship
is fully equipped for another voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus will her captain be encouraged
in his faithful efforts to steer our educational
craft—her crew inspired with
fresh hope, and healthy enthusiasm
created among all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The action of the Alumni will, to a
great extent, determine the future
standing of Trinity. Let it not be said
of them, “They knew their duty and
did it not.” With united action of the
Alumni and the Conference; endowment,
new building, loan fund, and
necessary equipments, will place our
college at the head of the list in North
Carolina.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been insinuated by those who
have a mistaken idea about <span class='sc'>The
Archive</span> that our Professor of English
is a member of the Editorial Staff.
A statement of fact will do no injury
to any one. <span class='sc'>The Archive</span> is published
by the two Literary Societies and
edited by different members taken from
these societies. Furthermore, each
staff of editors is responsible for whatever
may appear in their department.
Our Professor of English is only <i>Censor</i>,
and according to the true acceptation
of this term, his sole duty is to
decide whether a composition shall be
admitted to <span class='sc'>The Archive’s</span> columns,
just as England at one time had a
censor to examine every manuscript
before it could go to press. Please
remember that deciding whether an
article shall be published is not writing
that article.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>A month or so ago Prof. W. F. Tillett,
of Vanderbilt University, through
the columns of the <cite>Christian Advocate</cite>,
suggested that a conference of Southern
Methodist educators be held at
Nashville in the spring. The Professor’s
suggestion has met with hearty
approval from all of the most prominent
Methodist educators throughout
the South. This is a step in the right
direction. No church can expect to
prosper that neglects educational
work. Such a conference is well calculated
to arouse enthusiasm among
the various educators who attend, and
give an impetus to the cause of higher
education throughout the bounds of
the Southern Methodist Church. It is
to be hoped that plans will be devised
the good effects of which will be felt
for years to come. So long as the
Southern Methodist Church fosters her
educational institutions, so long does
she foster a powerful element of success.
Prof. Tillett’s article has the
right ring, and deserves a careful perusal
on the part of Southern Methodists.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>This is an era of invectives against
the capitalist, an age in which Capital
and Labor are fighting their greatest
battle. The Communists of France,
the Socialists and infidels of Germany,
the Agnostics of England and the Anarchists
of America are agitating in
the beer saloon and around the billiard
table one of the greatest reformations,
as they term it, the world has yet witnessed.
They hate the capitalist, and
at the very same time are making
capitalists out of the rumsellers. The
great question of to-day is to solve the
problem of Capital <i>versus</i> Labor. It
is a sad fact that the restless mass of
laborers instead of benefiting themselves
by their agitation are giving
power to the capitalist every day of
their lives by their dissipation. But
more than this, the iniquity of the
fathers will descend upon their ignorant
children, and degraded labor will
be the result.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>Petitions for prohibition in the District
of Columbia are being sent to
Congress from all parts of the country.
These petitions will probably receive
very little attention from the Congressmen,
yet they show that some of the
citizens of the Union are dissatisfied
with the customs in vogue at Washington.
Of late years it has gained
an unenviable reputation for the profligacy,
intemperance and debauchery,
in almost every form, that is carried
on within its limits. The Capital of a
Christian country should most assuredly
be otherwise. The city should undergo
a reformation, and a good prohibitory
law would be a very good
method by which to bring about this reformation.
The intemperance among
members of Congress is startling. The
legislators of a country, above all men,
should keep their brains free from the
influence of intoxicants. No man is
fit to make laws when his mind is
clouded by liquor. It would be a glorious
triumph for the grand principles
of prohibition if a prohibitory law
could be passed for the District of
Columbia.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>Rev. J. B. Bobbitt has recently issued
a circular calling upon Superintendents
to organize a Trinity College Sunday
School Endowment Fund, the object
of which is to arouse among the young
an interest in education and to keep
the subject continually before the minds
of the people at large. All collections
taken on the first Sunday in every month
are to go to the Endowment Fund.
A little from every pupil will make
a large amount, and still no parent will
feel it very burdensome. Every citizen
who is a friend of education, culture
and refinement ought to give
liberally for the endowment of institutions
of learning. Do not hoard up
money for your children. Not only
are they sometimes injured by receiving
a fortune, but very often ruined by
the expectation of it. The myths tell
of a miser of old for whose soul the
Tartarian gods could not find within
their domain a sufficient punishment,
who thereupon decided that the most
severe penalty would be to send him
back to earth and there let him see
how lavishly his children spent his
money.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>The ignorance of the majority of
young men about the national government
is really astonishing. Young
men who have had more than ordinary
educational advantages, and have considerable
general information, often exhibit
an entire lack of knowledge of
the Constitution and in fact of everything
pertaining to the general government.
How few young men ever read the
Constitution and study its meaning!
Yet these same young men will soon
be invested with all the rights, powers
and privileges of American citizenship,
if they have not been already. How can
such young men vote intelligently,
when they have scarcely any knowledge
of the nature of the government
under which they live? How can the
most sanguine patriot expect a good
government to continue to exist when
the average voter is so ignorant of politics?
This is the reason why lawyers
hold most of the responsible offices—they
are, as a rule, the only men who
study politics. Farmers will assemble
in a political convention, and nominate
a lawyer for some high office, and before
they leave the hall in which they
have met, will commence a tirade of
abuse because the lawyers hold all the
offices, while the honest, hard working
farmer is denied such privileges. The
farmers are themselves generally to
blame, as the majority of them are too
ignorant of the requisites to get their
rights. A copy of the Constitution
should be in every home where there is
any degree of intelligence, and the best
political newspapers should be taken.
In fact, every high school and college
should have a competent teacher to instruct
the rising generation of young
men in the Science of Government.
The voters of the future will then be
more intelligent than they have been
in the past.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>Dr. H. B. Battle, Director of the Experiment
Station, has recently made a
report of his analysis of various brands
of fertilizers used by North Carolina
farmers. This report also states that
the relative commercial value of fertilizing
ingredients has been considerably
reduced. An ammoniated fertilizer
valued at $22.00 last season will
be valued at $20.65 this season. This
is good for the farmers. The Experiment
Station is certainly of great benefit
to the Agricultural classes.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>It is not proposed to interfere with
the Endowment Fund by <i>soliciting</i> subscriptions
for the New Building; but an
effort is being made to raise money for
this purpose by concerts, lectures, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>The highest praise which we can give
this work, perhaps, is to say that the
above, which forms the elaborate title
page, falls far short of giving a full
summary of those qualities which go to
make the book more than highly prized
by all, both North and South, who reverently
hold in memory the deeds of
“Grand Heroes.” The author presents
a graphic and picturesque view of some
of the most striking scenes, adventures
and personages of the “late unpleasantness,”
with anecdotes and details,
concerning them. His position on
Gen. Stuart’s staff gave him the opportunity
of seeing the men and witnessing
the scenes of which he writes. Invention
has absolutely nothing to do
with the sketches; the writer having
recorded his recollections, and not his
fancies. This volume is a welcome addition
to the war literature. Such books
ought to be found in every Southern
home, that the memory of ’60–’65 may
be preserved for all time.</p>

by Clarence Stuart Ward.
Boston and New York. Houghton, Mifflin
and Company. 188 pp. 1887.</p>

<p class='c009'>The editor of this volume recognizing
the fact that few at the present
day have the leisure or interest to know
Shakespeare thoroughly, has provided
a means for increasing the general
knowledge of that author by arranging,
in a manner which admits of easy reference,
those passages of wit and humor
which must ever amuse and delight the
mind; those of wisdom and philosophy
from which the profoundest significance
of action and habit in life may be deduced;
and those of incomparable
beauty which have become the absolute
and fixed expression, never to be
changed or displaced in our language,
of the ideas they represent. This
compilation, therefore, contains all the
passages in Shakespeare, long or short,
which are of special significance, or of
inherent excellency, all those which a
speaker or writer might employ to lend
grace or vigor to his theme. While
the make-up of this little volume reflects
honor upon its editor, it certainly
does honor to the publishers who have
exercised no little care and taste in
giving the work its very commendable
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In number 341 of <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>,
there is an article on the Franco-Russian
Alliance, by Prince Nicolai
Nicolajewitch Galizyn—a letter to <cite>The
Figaro</cite>—upon the doctrines of Kathow,
the late celebrated diplomatist and politician
of Russia. The author begins
by tracing the history of diplomatic relations
between France and Russia from
the time of Peter The Great to the
present. Russia, in prosecuting her
scheme of obtaining the Bosphorus,
must have an ally in the West of Europe.
France is situated so as best to
fulfil that part, but France will derive
nothing by helping Russia fight her
wars; and, besides, the attitude of Germany
toward Russia is most peaceful.
From these main facts, the author
thinks that a war of Russia’s precipitation
would be far too rash for her present
weak military and financial affairs.
British statesmen who know the inner
aspect of things are acting wisely in
their policy of not preparing for war.
One cannot read the article in question
without feeling that the present newspaper

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Amusements and The Christian Life</span> in
the Primitive Church and in Our Day. By
Rev. L. C. Vass. Philadelphia, Presbyterian
Board of Publication, pp. 91.</p>

<p class='c009'>This little book, both on account of
the spiritual benefit to be derived from
it, and the interesting glimpses of
primitive church history contained in it,
is well worth reading. The author, an
eloquent divine of Newbern, N. C., has
divided his subject into two parts—Popular
Amusements and Primitive
Christians, and Lawful Christian
Amusements. He shows the effect of
amusements on the spiritual life of the
Christian in a very clear and easy style
made attractive by examples from authentic
history. The type is large and
leaded and the volume, taken as a
whole, is creditable to the printer as
well as to the author.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those interested in the history of our
State will be glad to know that a valuable
book, giving the history of the
counties of North Carolina, by Hon.
Kemp. P. Battle, LL. D., together with
an introduction and date of the erection
of those counties, etc., by Prof. W. A.
Blair, is now in press. The work is
the result of long labor among our official
records, and the names of its editors
are sufficient guarantee of its reliability.
This is more valuable material
for the man who is to write a history
of North Carolina which shall endure
as a literary monument. William A.
Blair, Winston, N. C., is the publisher.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Davidson Monthly</cite> takes <span class='sc'>The
Archive</span> to task for a failure in the
use of “respectable” grammar, and
refers to <cite>Reed and Kellogg</cite>, page 147,
where it says information may be obtained,
and where is found the following:
“<span class='sc'>Caution.</span>—Unless you wish to
<i>affirm</i>, do not use two negative words
so that they shall contradict each
other;” also “<span class='sc'>Caution.</span>—Do not use
adverbs for adjectives or adjectives for
adverbs.” The first caution refers to
use of negatives, therefore the critic
cannot mean this one. Does he mean
the second caution? Does he mean
that ‘most’ is an adverb where an adjective(?)
should be used, or that ‘most’
is an adjective(?), and that an adverb
is here needed? Perhaps the critic
meant that it is a case of improper
comparison, such as ‘roundest,’
‘straightest,’ etc., which the old grammars
vehemently denounced, though
the best writers use them. It was perhaps
a little irregular to consider ‘too
patent’ as an adjectival term of degrees,
and we thank our courteous
critic for his suggestion of ‘almost’
for ‘most.’ Still such terms as this are
in common use, and we confess a desire
to conform to the many.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <cite>Charlotte Chronicle</cite> of Jan. 27th,

in a February number of the same, a
complimentary notice of the college
and its work. The <cite>Chronicle</cite> is a

<p class='c009'>The Governor either must never

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c009'>There is a growing sentiment, meeting
the approval both of Faculties and
students, among the colleges, favoring
the abolition of the grading system.
In a recent number of the <cite>Student</cite>, a
journal devoted to the educational interests
of the Society of Friends, occurs
an article which advocates dispensing
with grades, or, if there must
be such a system, protests against its
being made a motive force to study.
As long as the working system remains,
so long will students work for figures
and not for knowledge. Grades are not
measures of scholarship, but only indicate
the result of a week’s “cramming.”
Knowledge thus acquired
makes the head very full one week,
but leaves it very empty the next.
Cornell has given the non-grading system
a trial and the results have proved
it satisfactory in every way.</p>

<p class='c009'>A prominent politician, not a thousand
miles from here, was heard to say
a few days ago: “Jeff Davis ought to
have been hung at the close of the war,
and a monument erected over the grave
of the truly great John Brown.” The
speaker was a Southern man, a Democrat,
and a Prohibitionist.—<cite>Exchange.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>The “speaker” may have <i>been</i>
a Southern man, but is not one <i>now</i>.
The man who says that Davis ought
to have been hung is at heart an alien
and an enemy to the South. The
“speaker” has also ceased to be a
Democrat, for Democrats don’t talk
that way. If the “speaker” be stripped
of his false apparel, he will be found
to shrink into a bundle of prohibition
fanaticism. This fanaticism and prejudice
has robbed him—like many others—of
truth and patriotism. The
prohibition cause is a good one. Its
advocates cannot forward it by censuring
Jeff Davis, but on the other hand,
will greatly damage it.</p>

troops were the last to lower the Southern
flag to Northern numbers. It is

to receive notice of surrender and orders
of disbandment. At that time his
headquarters were in Trinity College,
at the house of Dr. Craven, at whose
front gate the official flag was planted.
Here on a lovely morning in May, 1865,
his daughter, Miss Annie Hardie, accompanied
by the staff and many weeping
and tattered soldiers, while the
college bell, near by, tolled the requiem
of the Southern Confederacy, and while
